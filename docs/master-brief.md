# Kaiku master brief — progress ledger

The complete brief of 12 August 2026, broken into individually checkable
requirements. This file is the record of what was asked for and what state each
item is in. **It is updated as work lands, not at the end.**

Status key:

| Mark  | Meaning                                                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[x]` | Done, and verifiable in the repo or in Sanity                  |
| `[~]` | Partly done — the note says what is left                       |
| `[ ]` | Not started                                                    |
| `[!]` | **Blocked on Damien** — cannot be finished by code alone       |
| `[-]` | Deliberately not done — the note says why, for you to overrule |

---

## Standing constraints

These override anything below. Written down because they have been re-stated
more than once.

- Do **not** change product names, or strip the `| Kaiku` suffix.
- Do **not** hide anything from the navigation. (Superseded only for Cold Plunge
  and Outdoor Kitchen, which you asked to be re-parented.)
- Do **not** import prices from supplier feeds. Prices are yours.
- Do **not** change lead times. Only make sure the lead time appears inside the
  paragraph on the delivery page.
- Do **not** change the desktop site unnecessarily.
- Do **not** touch the pergolas category.
- Category hero images are **desktop-only**.
- No supplier data feed. Every product is written individually, not copied from
  the supplier's description.
- Email support only — no phone support.
- Nothing that defeats a supplier's bot protection (Aosom/Akamai, D.I. Designs
  CAPTCHA). I have refused this and will keep refusing it.
- Prefer short numbered step-by-step instructions when you have to do something.

See `docs/first-sale-plan.md` for what these gate.

### The deploy — the builds all succeed, nothing is promoted to Production

**This is the whole cause, and it is a Vercel setting, not a code problem.**

Every push to the repository triggers a Vercel build, and **every build
succeeds** — "Deployment has completed", state `success`, checked via the GitHub
Deployments API. But every one of the last 30 deployments, going back to
11 August, was created in the **`Preview`** environment. **Not one is
`Production`.** So each build lands on a `*.vercel.app` URL and kaikuhome.com is
never updated — it stays pinned to whatever deployment currently holds the
domain, which is a build from around 6 August.

Dated precisely: the homepage markup on kaikuhome.com matches
`shop-by-category.tsx` exactly as it stood at commit `014c2a5`, **6 August
21:55** — no `h2`, `lg:py-20` padding, `33vw` image sizes. 140 commits since have
built successfully and gone nowhere.

**The fix, in the Vercel dashboard:**

1. Project → **Settings → Git → Production Branch**. It is pointing at a branch
   that is not being pushed. Set it to **`main`**, which is now current.
2. Then Project → **Deployments** → newest → **⋯ → Promote to Production**. That
   puts today's work live immediately without waiting for another push.
3. Check **Settings → Domains** while you are there: if `kaikuhome.com` is
   assigned to a specific deployment rather than to Production, reassign it.

Everything is viewable right now at the newest preview URL while you are signed
in to Vercel — previews sit behind Vercel Authentication, so it asks you to log
in first.

**Corrections to what I said earlier in the session.** I reported the
module-scope Stripe client and the strict env validation as "the build failure
killing every deploy". That was wrong. Those broke _CI_, which runs without
secrets; Vercel has the keys set, so its builds were already passing. The
`.vercelignore` is likewise a real improvement — the deployment payload drops
from 288MB to 109MB — but a 288MB payload was not stopping anything either. All
three changes are worth keeping on their own merits. None of them was the reason
the site was not updating.

`supplier-pages/` being 179MB of a 288MB tree is still worth knowing: it was
committed on 9 August, nothing at runtime reads it, and the git history is
permanently 166MB heavier, which slows every clone including Vercel's. Removing
it properly means rewriting history and force-pushing, so that is your call.

### `main` and the branch had no merge base

Separate from the above, and worth knowing. `main` ended 17 July; this line of
work begins 26 July. Chronologically continuous, but git had them recorded as
unrelated histories — almost certainly a fresh clone rather than a branch off
`main`.

Resolved with a merge using `-s ours`, which keeps this branch's tree exactly as
it is and records `main`'s old tip as a second parent. Nothing was discarded:
all 48 of `main`'s commits remain reachable, and `main` fast-forwarded rather
than being force-pushed. The only files `main` carried that this line does not
are ten superseded homepage components and `product-specs.tsx`, none of them
imported anywhere.

### CI had failed on every run since 15 July

Not caused by this work — it predates it — but it meant no automated check had
passed on the deployed branch for a month, so nothing was catching anything.
Four separate faults, all now fixed:

1. **`prettier --check` was checking 74 saved supplier HTML pages.** Other
   people's markup, downloaded verbatim as the offline reference the catalogue
   audit is checked against. Now in `.prettierignore`, along with `backups/`.
   Eight genuinely unformatted source files were formatted.
2. **The e2e suite asserted the homepage title was "Create Next App"** — the
   Next.js scaffold default, never updated after the storefront was built.
   Fixed, plus a second test that checks real catalogue rows arrived, because
   `sanityFetch` is fail-soft and a site that cannot reach Sanity still answers
   200 with the right title and no content.
3. **`typecheck` depended on a type Next.js only emits during a build.**
   `RouteContext<…>` is a global written into `.next/types`, and CI typechecks
   before it builds — so it failed on a clean checkout while passing on any
   machine with a stale `.next` lying around. That is why it reached the branch.
4. **A failed env check did not say which variable was missing.** Seven
   identical "expected string, received undefined" lines with no names
   attached. It now names them, which matters most in a hosting build log — the
   lack of it has already cost one wrong guess in this repo's history.

### Why the deploy was failing, and what was done about it

Every Vercel deployment errored from 15 July to 12 August, so the live site was
the last build that succeeded before that. Confirmed by content, not guesswork:
`/compare` and `/quote` both said "coming soon", and product pages still carried
hardcoded strings deleted weeks ago.

Two build-killers were found by reproducing a build with no environment at all.

**1. The Stripe client was constructed at module scope.**

```
Error: Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided
  at Object.<anonymous> (.next/server/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.js:10:3)
> Build error occurred
Error: Failed to collect page data for /api/webhooks/stripe
```

`next build` evaluates every route module while collecting page data, so a
client built at import has to be constructible in the _build_ environment — a
requirement no route actually has, since the key is needed when a request
arrives. One API route failed the whole build. Stripe checkout was added on
15 July, the day the deploys started erroring.

**2. Any single unset variable killed the build.** `createEnv` threw during page
data collection, the build died on `/_not-found`, and the error named no
variable — seven identical "expected string, received undefined" lines. There
was nothing to act on, which is how this survived a month.

The requirement was never real: the build compiles pages and prerenders content
from Sanity, which reads without a token. Everything else is needed at request
time. So those variables are optional now and checked where they are used, by
`requireEnv`, which names the variable and what stopped working —
"STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is not set, so payment confirmations cannot be verified".
A missing Stripe key now means checkout reports a configuration error; it no
longer means the catalogue is offline.

Two smaller things fell out of it. `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` is read nowhere in
`src/` — required, used by nothing, able to fail a deploy on its own. And
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is now an override rather than a requirement, with
absolute URLs coming from `siteConfig.url`: two sources of truth for one origin
meant Stripe could return a paying customer to a host that 308-redirects,
carrying a `session_id`, on the most fragile step in the funnel.

**Verified:** `next build` completes with an entirely empty environment and
validation switched on — 162 pages — and CI is green for the first time since
15 July.

**Still yours to check:** that the deployment actually went out, and that the
production environment has real values for Stripe, Supabase and Resend. The site
will now build without them; it will not take payments without them. Do **not**
mark any `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable as Sensitive — that took the site down once
before. If a deploy still errors, the log will now name the variable.

## Part 1 — Mission, position and working rules

### Business objective

- [~] **500 daily visitors within 3 months.** Foundation work in progress; see
  Part 3. No promise of the number — the plan is to build the strongest
  foundation for it.
- [x] **Every change answers: does this help trust, traffic, rankings,
      conversions or revenue?** Used as the filter on every item below.

### Working rules

- [x] Audit → identify cause → design solution → implement → test → report.
- [x] Don't rush; use initiative; think like a business owner.
- [~] **Report after completing work** — completed / problems found / next
  actions / metrics. This file is that report, kept live.

---

## Part 2 — Mobile and the product catalogue

### Mobile — Priority #1

- [x] Mobile homepage: **remove the featured coffee table card** under the hero
      (`hero.tsx`, `hidden … lg:flex`).
- [x] Mobile homepage: **Explore Collections button has sharp edges**, not
      rounded (`rounded-none`).
- [x] Mobile homepage: **reduce element sizes** (hero `min-h` steps down from
      40rem to 26rem on a phone).
- [x] **Mobile shopping page exists** — `/shop/[category]` and
      `/shop/room/[room]` now render the white shopping page, not the dark tile
      page.
- [x] Mobile shopping page **supports all named collections**: Outdoor Living,
      Saunas, Wellness Accessories, Cold Plunge, Outdoor Kitchen, Living Room,
      Bedroom, Kitchen, Office, Bathroom, Lighting, Mirrors, Storage,
      Furniture.
- [x] **Category browsing fixed** — five faults in the category bar; the drill
      nav no longer loses the active room; tapping a category no longer bounces
      back to the dark page.
- [x] **Product grid** — three columns on a phone, tighter gutters, two-line
      title clamp, so ~9 products fit a screen instead of ~4.
- [x] **Category hero image no longer downloaded on mobile** — it was fetching
      the 3840w variant behind `display:none`.
- [x] **Category page image sizing on mobile** — measured at 390px in Chromium
      rather than guessed at. Coffee Tables downloads 0.49MB across 20 images,
      largest variant 640px, no horizontal overflow; the homepage is 0.38MB. The
      giant-images fault was fixed by the grid rewrite. One real fault did turn
      up in the screenshot: Pershore led its tile with a close-up of the table
      edge while every other tile showed a whole table — now corrected by a
      tight-crop rule in `preferredOrder`, which fires on 5 products of 92.
- [ ] **App-like feel** — bottom navigation bar, larger tap targets, sheet-style
      filters.
- [ ] **Mobile-first review of every remaining page** — cart, checkout, account,
      journal, tools.

### Catalogue accuracy audit

- [~] **Audit every product against its supplier page**: name, category,
  subcategory, description, materials, dimensions, weight, colours,
  variants, images, SKU, price, availability, delivery.
  Pipeline and validator built (`scripts/lib/product-copy.ts`,
  `scripts/build-copy-manifest.ts`); 78 supplier URLs paired and corrected;
  14 of 77 descriptions rewritten.
- [x] **Corrections report** — `scripts/audit-description-artefacts.ts` and the
      copy manifest.
- [x] 8 outbound `utm_source=chatgpt.com` links removed (4 pointed at your own
      supplier, 2 at competitors).
- [x] Pasted assistant text removed from a live product page.
- [x] Notes-to-self removed from 2 live pages; 6 "Copy" headings fixed.
- [x] 269 stray `h1`s inside descriptions demoted to `h2`.
- [x] 3 wrong `sourceUrl`s corrected — 2 pointed at the basket.
- [ ] **Pershore weight** — 21 kg stored, 28 kg on the supplier page. Reported,
      not changed, because changing a spec needs your call.

### Image system

- [x] **Investigated why higher-quality images do not publish / revert after
      deployment / do not save** — `docs/image-audit.md`. Three separate causes,
      and **nothing in the pipeline degrades images**: six images were
      re-uploaded from a Sanity thumbnail (two Hamptons are 146×146 with
      filenames claiming 2000×2000); 15 products have image changes sitting
      unpublished in a draft, which is exactly what "it reverted after
      deployment" looks like; nine images are genuinely too small.
- [!] **Publish the 15 drafts** — listed in the audit. Left for you on purpose: a
  draft can carry half-finished text changes alongside the image change.
- [!] **Re-upload the two 146×146 Hampton images** from D.I. Designs. The
  original is gone; re-publishing cannot recover it.
- [x] **Automated image ordering** — `scripts/derive-studio-shots.ts` classifies
      every image from the thumbnail Sanity already stores, no downloads. 353
      catalogue shots flagged, 75 setting shots, 35 galleries reordered to lead
      with the catalogue shot. `isStudioShot` was set on **0 of 439** images
      before this, so the card-hover swap had never fired once.
- [x] **Hover image is now the lifestyle shot** — it was derived backwards, and
      falls back to the second photo for the 57 products shot only on white.
- [x] **Image quality audited** — median 2000px, but a bad tail: 9 unusable
      (under 700px), 25 soft (under 1200px), listed in the audit.
- [x] **Alt text on every image** — 178 of 439 to 439 of 439
      (`scripts/derive-image-alt.ts`), built only from facts the document can
      prove. Editor-written text is never overwritten.
- [ ] **Four assets shared between two products** — replacing one changes the
      other. The two SaunaPlunge Bronte cabins (2-person and 6-person) share
      photographs, which is a customer-expectation problem as well as a data one.

### Product SEO

- [~] Per product: title, meta title, meta description, slug, H1, description,
  FAQs, internal links, alt text, structured data. Structured data and H1
  done; the rest runs with the description rewrite.
- [~] **Every description unique.** 14 of 77 rewritten against a validator that
  refuses banned phrases and duplicate FAQ answers.

### Required product page information

- [~] Introduction, design story, materials/craftsmanship, key features, room
  suitability, styling advice, specifications, delivery, returns, warranty,
  FAQs, comparison, related products. Section scaffolding and formatting
  done (`product-description-components.tsx`, green ticks, rules above every
  h2); content lands per product with the rewrite.
- [x] **Comparison** — built, `/compare?products=a,b`.
- [ ] **RETURNS heading present, bold and consistent on every product page.**
- [ ] **Large furniture delivery disclaimer** — doorstep delivery, white glove
      not included unless arranged, positioned as the transparency that funds
      the pricing.

### FAQ system

- [~] **Unique FAQs per product, no duplicated answers.** Validator enforces it;
  applied to the products rewritten so far.

### Tag system

- [~] **Material, colour, style, room, product type.** Derivation engine written
  (`scripts/lib/product-tags.ts`, 1,159 lines, evidence-carrying and
  veto-based); canonical vocabulary now shared
  (`src/lib/catalog/facets.ts`). Not yet dry-run, applied, or wired to
  filters.

### Price, stock and delivery

- [ ] **Price audit.** Report only — no automatic price reductions.
- [ ] **Stock audit**, especially furniture colour variants.
- [ ] **Live stock tracking plan** (Supabase).
- [ ] **Delivery lead-time distribution report** — how many products sit on each
      timeframe, to find inconsistent promises.
- [x] **Lead time appears inside the paragraph** on the delivery page.

### Product database

- [ ] **Complete product database / spreadsheet** with every required field:
      product name, supplier, supplier URL, Kaiku URL, SKU, supplier SKU, cost
      price, selling price, profit margin, category, subcategory, room, product
      type, variants, colours, materials, dimensions, weight, stock status,
      supplier stock status, delivery lead time, images, lifestyle images, SEO
      title, meta description, slug, alt text, description status, FAQ status,
      internal linking status, last checked date.
- [ ] Structured from the start for thousands of products, multiple suppliers,
      automated stock and price checking, SEO monitoring, content management,
      supplier management.

### Supplier product mapping

- [ ] Per supplier: supplier product name, supplier URL, Kaiku product name,
      Kaiku URL, supplier category, Kaiku category, supplier stock, Kaiku
      availability, supplier price, Kaiku price.

## Part 3 — SEO authority building

### Objective

- [ ] Become an authority for outdoor living, garden wellness, luxury
      furniture, home improvement, garden design, saunas, cold plunge, outdoor
      kitchens.
- [x] **No AI filler.** Enforced by the banned-phrase validator.

### Search intent and content clusters

- [ ] **Intent-led content** — "best outdoor sofas for UK gardens", "how to
      choose an outdoor sofa", "what material is best for outdoor furniture",
      "outdoor sofa maintenance".
- [ ] **Topic clusters**, e.g. the outdoor sauna cluster: buying guide, indoor
      vs outdoor comparison, benefits, installation, materials, maintenance,
      small garden ideas — all interlinked.

### Category page SEO

- [ ] Every category page needs: SEO introduction, buying guidance, FAQs,
      internal links, related categories, product explanations. **No empty
      product grids.**
- [ ] Worked examples: Outdoor Furniture (materials, weather resistance,
      maintenance, styling); Coffee Tables (size guide, materials, styling, room
      suitability).

### Product page SEO

- [~] Unique title, description, FAQs, alt text, metadata per product; no
  duplicated supplier wording.
- [x] **Meta title strategy** — brand + product + intent, e.g. "Hampton Ivory
      Console Table | Luxury Shagreen Hall Furniture | Kaiku". Already the
      pattern; names are not to be changed.
- [ ] **Meta description strategy** — benefit, material, style, intent. Audit
      outstanding.

### URLs, images, linking

- [ ] **Slug audit** — short, descriptive, keyword-relevant, no filler.
- [~] **Image SEO** — alt text now on all 439 images. Filenames: only 4 of 439
  are undescriptive (`image-6.png`, `6.jpg.webp`, `7.jpg.webp`,
  `19.jpg.webp`), so this is much smaller than it looked.
- [ ] **Internal linking system** — every product links to related products,
      category pages, buying guides, room inspiration.

### Content plan

- [ ] **SEO content calendar** across Outdoor Living, Wellness and Furniture.
- [ ] **Blog strategy** — every article carries a target keyword, search intent,
      products to link, related categories, an FAQ section.
- [ ] **Buying guides** — sofa, coffee table sizing, furniture materials, garden
      furniture, outdoor kitchen, pergola, sauna, cold plunge, home wellness.
- [ ] **Comparison pages** — indoor vs outdoor sauna, wood vs aluminium garden
      furniture, cold plunge vs traditional recovery, coffee table materials.

### Sanity as the central system

- [~] Sanity controls product information, SEO, categories, content, images,
  internal linking, product relationships.
- [~] **Product schema** — basic, commercial, product and SEO field groups.
  Mostly present; facet fields being added now.
- [ ] **Category schema as an SEO landing page** — SEO title, meta description,
      introduction, buying guide, FAQ, featured products, related categories,
      internal links.
- [ ] **Bulk editing** — bulk SEO, category, image and metadata updates without
      touching products one at a time.

### Technical SEO

- [x] **Product schema markup**, price, availability, brand.
- [x] **Breadcrumb schema** on category pages.
- [x] **Article schema** with author and dates.
- [ ] **Technical SEO audit** — page speed, mobile performance, Core Web Vitals,
      sitemap, robots.txt, canonicals, duplicate pages, broken links,
      redirects.
- [ ] **Soft-404s on the 7 deleted Aosom product URLs.** Checked after the
      deletion: they render the not-found page but answer **HTTP 200**, not 404.
      Google treats a soft-404 as a live thin page and keeps it indexed, so these
      stay in the index competing with real products. Two things to separate
      before fixing: whether it is a stale-cache artefact of the 6 August build
      (`x-nextjs-stale-time: 300`, `x-vercel-cache: HIT`) or a genuine fault in
      how `notFound()` behaves on a prerendered route once its data disappears.
      **Re-check immediately after the deploy is promoted.** If it persists, the
      right answer for permanently removed products is a 301 to the category
      rather than a 404 — they were indexed, and a redirect keeps the link equity
      and gives a visitor somewhere to go.
- [x] **Wrong-category product URLs no longer resolve.** The live 6 August build
      serves the same product under every category slug —
      `/shop/water-features/portable-charcoal-bbq-grill` and
      `/shop/lighting/portable-charcoal-bbq-grill` both answered 200 — which is
      textbook duplicate content, one URL per category. The current code guards
      it (`found.category !== category` → `notFound()`), so this clears with the
      deploy. Recorded because it explains any duplicate-content warnings already
      in Search Console.
- [ ] **Google Shopping preparation** — audit titles, descriptions, images,
      prices, availability, product categories. Merchant feed built but gated
      off.
- [ ] **Search Console plan** — impressions, clicks, average position, CTR,
      indexed pages, coverage errors, queries; monthly reporting.

## Part 4 — Homepage and shopping experience

### Hero

- [x] Keep the "Spaces that slow life down" direction.
- [~] Improve typography, image selection, text positioning, contrast, CTA,
  mobile layout. Mobile layout and CTA done; image selection outstanding
  (avoid generic stock photography).
- [x] Brand positioning, headline, supporting statement, primary CTA. No
      aggressive sales language.

### Discovery

- [x] **Category scroll section** — white panel, horizontal scroll, premium
      cards, works on desktop and mobile, expands as categories are added (24
      categories, up from a curated handful).
- [x] **Scroll rail returns** — it scrolled right and would not come back;
      Lenis was capturing the gesture. Fixed with `data-lenis-prevent`.
- [x] **Heading corrected** — said "Start by room" over a row of categories.
- [x] **New & Noteworthy** — white background, horizontal scroll, mobile swipe,
      premium cards, D.I. Designs furniture cheapest-first.
- [ ] Editorial sections and buying inspiration on the homepage.

### Shopping experience

- [x] **The dark tile page no longer interrupts shopping.** Category and room
      URLs render the white page; the dark page is the `/shop` index only.
- [x] **Category navigation fixed** — no backwards redirects, no incorrectly
      reopening categories.
- [x] **Outdoor Living** audited — 1 product showing, then 9, now 12.
- [x] **Saunas** shows saunas only — 11 items down to 7; oils and accessories
      removed.
- [x] **Wellness Accessories** appears in Sauna, Outdoor Living and its own
      category (`additionalDepartments` + `excludeFromRoomGrid`).
- [x] **Cold Plunge and Outdoor Kitchen** re-parented.
- [ ] **Filtering and sorting** on the white shopping pages. In progress.
- [ ] **Colour filters as visual circles** — White, Black, Oak, Walnut, Grey,
      Green, Natural, Brown.
- [ ] **Variant filtering** — selecting "black furniture" shows the black
      version's image, not the default.
- [ ] **Category page value** — listings plus SEO content, filters, buying
      guides, FAQs, related categories.

## Part 5 — Product pages and conversion

- [~] **Consistent premium structure**, all 14 sections in order.
- [~] **Every description unique**; explains what makes it different, design
  characteristics, materials, practical benefits, suitable rooms, styling,
  customer considerations.
- [ ] **Empty side panel fix** — decorative line artwork, architectural
      patterns, organic shapes, botanical line drawings, minimal luxury
      illustration. Not product images. Varied by department: wood-grain lines
      for furniture, water patterns for wellness, garden linework for outdoor.
- [x] **Section formatting** — rules between sections, proper spacing, premium
      typography, no large blocks of text, scannable.
- [ ] **RETURNS** heading — bold, consistent, clearly visible, on every page.
- [~] **Delivery information** — lead time, availability, delivery method,
  matching the supplier.
- [ ] **Delivery lead time report.**
- [ ] **Large furniture disclaimer.**
- [~] **Unique, SEO-focused, product-specific FAQs.**
- [x] **Comparison feature** — price, dimensions, material, colour, features,
      delivery time, availability, specifications, side by side.
- [ ] **Meaningful related products** — by room, style, material, intent and
      buying journey. Currently a manual `relatedProducts` field with no
      derivation.

## Part 6 — Business systems and conversion

- [ ] **Checkout audit** — add to basket, basket, checkout, payment,
      confirmation, customer emails.
- [!] **Stripe** — live payments, payment methods, checkout flow, order
  confirmation, failed payment handling, receipts. Blocked on live keys.
- [!] **Full test order before launch.**
- [~] **Customer accounts** — create, view orders, save details, track
  purchases. Pages exist; needs an audit.
- [~] **Email system** — welcome, order confirmation, payment confirmation,
  shipping update, delivery notification, abandoned basket, account
  creation, follow-up. Order confirmation and owner alert are wired into the
  Stripe webhook; the rest are not built. All blocked on `RESEND_API_KEY`.
- [ ] **10% off second order for creating an account** — framed as joining the
      Kaiku community, not as a hard sell.
- [~] **Product badges** — new arrival, low stock, limited availability, popular
  choice, coming soon. Premium wording only; no "SALE!". Field exists,
  nothing populates it.
- [ ] **Live stock infrastructure** — supplier stock checks, variant
      availability, lead times, automatic updates.
- [x] **20 suppliers not yet emailed** — `docs/supplier-targets-20.md`, with
      company, website, products, fit, contact method, approach.
- [x] **Instant-signup suppliers** — `docs/supplier-instant-signup.md`. Written
      because the 20-supplier list is getting no replies, which is what happens
      to every new retailer approaching premium brands with no trading history.
      Nine UK/EU platforms with automated or near-automated approval, mapped
      onto the 19 empty categories, plus the five to open first. A VAT number is
      not generally required, which matters as you are below the threshold.
- [x] **Aosom range deleted** — all 32 documents (7 published, 25 drafts), backed
      up to `backups/aosom-products-2026-08-12T20-33-09-707Z.json` first. They
      had not accepted the application. This emptied 8 more categories, which is
      what makes the instant-signup list urgent rather than optional.
- [ ] **Supplier outreach emails** positioning Kaiku as a premium,
      content-driven partner rather than another reseller.
- [ ] **High-ticket product pages** — buying guides, FAQs, comparisons,
      installation information.
- [x] **Quote page** — name, email, phone, product, quantity, project type,
      budget, timeline, message, with a `quoteRequest` document type in Studio.
- [~] **Trust improvements** — delivery, returns, contact, brand story, supplier
  credibility, quality messaging.
- [ ] **Competitor positioning** — premium products, competitive pricing, expert
      guidance, better experience. Not price-only.

## Part 7 — Technical foundation and scaling

- [ ] **Technical audit** — frontend, backend, CMS, images, database, APIs,
      performance, mobile, error handling. Identify technical debt, poor
      architecture, scalability problems.
- [~] **Sanity optimisation** — review every content model; products,
  categories, SEO fields, image manageability, relationships.
- [ ] **Bulk editing tools.**
- [ ] **Supabase architecture** — products, suppliers, inventory, SEO tracking
      tables as specified.
- [ ] **Image management fixes** — high-resolution display, updates saving,
      persistence after deployment, automatic optimisation. Audit CDN, image
      optimisation, cache, CMS references, frontend rendering.
- [~] **Performance** — mobile, LCP, image loading, JS size, unused code,
  animations, fonts, caching. One real win so far: the mobile hero image is
  no longer downloaded behind `display:none`.
- [ ] **Analytics** — visitors, sources, product views, category views, search
      usage, add to basket, checkout starts, purchases, quote requests, email
      signups.
- [ ] **Conversion tracking** — which products get attention, which categories
      perform, where users leave, which pages convert, which SEO pages bring
      customers.
- [ ] **Search** — products, categories, materials, colours, styles, rooms.
      "black coffee table", "oak furniture", "garden sauna", "green sofa".
- [~] **Filter architecture** — category, colour, material, price, brand,
  availability, style, room, product type. In progress.
- [ ] **Supplier integration preparation** — feeds, CSV imports, APIs, stock
      feeds, addable without a rebuild.
- [ ] **Security audit** — payments, customer data, forms, authentication, APIs.
- [ ] **Error monitoring** — broken pages, failed images, checkout errors, API
      failures, CMS problems.

## Part 8 — Execution order

The phase order is the order of work.

1. **Phase 1 — fix broken experiences.** Mobile, category navigation, image
   publishing, incorrect products, broken pages, missing information.
2. **Phase 2 — product quality.** Every product correct: information, images,
   categories, pricing, stock, SEO, unique descriptions.
3. **Phase 3 — SEO foundation.** Product, category and technical SEO, internal
   linking, content structure.
4. **Phase 4 — conversion.** Product pages, checkout, trust signals, quote
   system, customer journey.
5. **Phase 5 — scale.** More suppliers, products, categories, automation.

### Metrics to monitor

Traffic · rankings · product views · conversion rate · enquiries · sales.

None of these can be read yet: analytics is not implemented and the current
build is not deployed.

## Where Phase 1 actually stands

Mobile and category navigation are largely fixed **in the repo**. Three Phase 1
items remain genuinely open:

1. **Image publishing** — not investigated at all. This is the largest untouched
   Phase 1 item and it is a data-integrity problem, so it comes next.
2. **Category page image sizing on mobile** — needs checking against a real
   deploy.
3. **App-like navigation** — bottom bar, sheet filters.

And the whole of Phase 1 is invisible to customers until item 1 in _Blocked on
you_ is cleared.
